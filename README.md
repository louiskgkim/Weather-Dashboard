## 1. Description
The purpose of this challenge was to use third-party API's by accessing their data and making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This weather dashboard will show today's current weather data and the next five days weather forecast of the searched city.

To simply use the dashboard you would simply add a city in the search bar and click enter or the icon to search the current city's weather and its five day weather forecast. The dashboard will display the weather, wind speed and humidity.
